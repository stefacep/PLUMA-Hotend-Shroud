# PLUMA-Hotend-Shroud
A seamless solution for integrating a mk8 class hotend or an NF-Crazy Plus hotend with a bmg extruder on linear rail or v-wheel equipped ender 3, ender 3 pro and ender 3 V2 Printers

## Possible Configurations:
- Stock(Mk8,  Microswiss) Hotend, Stock Body or MGN12 Body Chassis, ABL,4020 or 5015 Fang
- NF Crazy Plus, MGN12 Body Chassis, ABL, 4020 or 5015 Fang

The BOM on the pdf is for the Stock configuration, the BOM for the alternate configuration will come soon

## 
In early-mid 2020, upon looking for potential solutions, i have not found a solution for the ender 3 printer that integrates both a microswiss/mk8 class hotend with a bmg hotend is not invasive to the point that a hotend swap is required nor a translation of the y axis extrusion to recoup the lost build space.

As a result the product was designed and prototyped in July 2020 and tested with several iterations for the latter part of 2020, with minimal tweaks to increase useability as well as part cooling effectiveness

In early 2021, upon switching to a NF-Crazy hotend and an MGN12 motion system, PLUMA was derived to support both architectures with the main chassis being able to directly interface with the linear rail carriage without the original aluminum x plate, therefore reducing complexity and weight

The original fang that supports a 4020 was also derived to support a 5015 in mid 2021
